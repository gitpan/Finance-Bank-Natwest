    Finance::Bank::Natwest - Check your Natwest bank accounts from Perl

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides a rudimentary interface to the Natwest online

    either C<Crypt::SSLeay> or C<IO::Socket::SSL> installed for HTTPS
    support to work with LWP.

SYNOPSIS
      my $nw = Finance::Bank::Natwest->new( credentials => 'Constant',
                                            credentials_options => {
					       dob => '010179',
					       uid => '0001',
					       password => 'Password',
					       pin => '4321' } );

      my @accounts = $nw->accounts;

      foreach (@accounts) {
            printf "%25s : %6s / %8s : GBP %8.2f\n",
              $_->{name}, $_->{sortcode}, $_->{account}, $_->{available};
      }
